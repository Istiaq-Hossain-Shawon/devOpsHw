## OSI MODEL:
#### This is introduced in 1984 in order to compute succesully communication between computers
#### 7 Layers:
#### 1.Application Layers:
It is used by network applications like file transfer, web surfing,email using ftp,https/http,smtp protocols .
#### 2.Presentation Layers:
It convert data using data translation(charecters/numbers to bits) and use data compression to compressed data.It also do the data encryption/decryption..
#### 3.Session Layer:
Its managed authentication ,authorization .In session management it track the data packet that contains text and images .
#### 4.Transport Layer:
It do the segmentation,error handling.Data receive as segments that contains small data unit.This data unit  contains sequence number and source and destination port number.
It also manage the data flow controls.Here TCP and UDP is used for data transmission.
#### 5.Network layer:
Data receive as packets.It do logical addressing(ip and mask address used ) ,routing and path determination(for minimum distance )
#### 6.Data Link Layer:
Physical addressing is done in data link layer.Data is receive as frame.It provide access to media link wire, wireless,radio etc
#### 7.Physical Layer:
Physical layer convert frame data to signal to send using media.
